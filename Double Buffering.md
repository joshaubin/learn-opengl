When an app is drawn in a single buffer, it may flicker because buffers are not drawn in an instant, but drawn pixel by pixel (Think CRT). To avoid artifacts, windowing applications use **Double Buffering**. The front buffer contains the final output image shown on the screen, while all the rendering commands draw to the back buffer. As soon as the rendering commands are finished we swap the buffers.
